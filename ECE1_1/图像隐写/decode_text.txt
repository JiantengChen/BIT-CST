I'm an undergraduate student majored in Computer Science in Peking University. Tired of the boring courses, I began self-learning totally after my fresh year. This repository contains all the resources I used to self-learning. The links below will take you either to another repository which contains my solution for homework and course projects or to the course website where you can get full guidance.

If you feel quite painful to take the courses at unversity. Trust me, there is high possibility that it's not your duty. Computer Science is so interesting and everyone should enjoy it if you have a good teacher to teach you a good course.

All the courses in this repository are developed in MIT, UC Berkeleys, Princeton, Harvard ...... , and I guarantee you will have a completely different experience to take these courses !

Let's self-learning together and get better together !
